*Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mabo*

I'm currently a Mathematics and Computer Science student at the University of South Africa. I'm interested in figuring out how abstract mathematical reasoning and computing intersect. This implies that my work and interests lie at the intersection of algorithms, system design, and artificial intelligence.

Though recognizing the importance of using built-in abstraction in code, I often enjoy building projects from scratch and figuring out the mechanics at work within systems - from hardware architecture that runs code to mathematical models that are the basis of logic and computation.

*Topics of interest*: Neural networks, operating systems, differential equations, graph theory and combinatorics, mathematical logic and formal systems, and problem-solving.

Outside coding and mathematics I enjoy running, and gaming.
